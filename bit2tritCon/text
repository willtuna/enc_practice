Sadi Guven said the president "received the absolute majority of all valid votes", but gave no further details.
State media reports put Mr Erdogan on 53% with 99% of votes counted, and his closest rival Muharrem Ince on 31%.
The opposition is yet to officially concede but said it would continue its democratic fight "whatever the result".
